                    but it's not the content that visitors see when they visit your site.

                <p>
                    A host is the house of your website on the internet while a domain name is the address of the house your
                    website.The domain name is the web address that you type in a browser or search engine. The location of 
                    your website. A domain name directs people to your website while a host is where your website is located.
